#Abstract


# Introduction
## Topic and Context
Briefly describe the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as a neurodevelopmental spectrum condition and introduce the concept of neurodiversity.

## Theoretical Framework
Explain that CBT focuses on cognitive restructuring and social-skills training, whereas VR provides safe, immersive practice of real-world interactions.

## Summary of Previous Work
Cite references from the brief that demonstrate the therapeutic value of CBT and VR.

## Rationale
Why are we doing this study? This study investigates which method yileds greater improvements in AQ

## Hypotesis
#### **H1:** After controlling for baseline AQ, there will be no group differences in post-treatment (null-hypothesis)

### **H2:** Both CBT abd VR therapy groups will show significant reductions in AQ scores from pre-treatment to post-treatment, while the control group will not

### **H3:** ???

# Method
#### **Participants:** 300 adults (M = 150, F = 150), aged 12-40. Random assignment to CBT (n = 100), VR (n = 100), Control (n = 100).

#### **Design:** Mixed 3 (Group: CBT, VR, Control - between subjects) x 2 (Time: Pre, Post - within-subjects) design.

#### **Materials:** Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) 50-item questionnaire, scored 0-50.1.

#### **Procedure:** Each participant completed AQ before and after 12 weeks of therapy.

+ CBT: Weekly sessions on social/emotional regulation.

+ VR: Immersive simulations for social interaction.

+ Control: No intervention.

Data recorded in columns P1_Pre_Score and P2_Post_Score.
